QUERY 1: What happens when the circumcenter is on the side of the triangle?
----------------------------------------
RETRIEVED EVIDENCE & CONTEXT:
PATH 1: the circumcenter is located on the side of the triangle -> the triangle is acute
SOURCE CONTEXT: ... the midpoint of the side and being perpendicular to it, forming a right angle with it. The three perpendicular bisectors meet in a single point, the triangle's circumcenter; this point is the center of the circumcircle, the circle passing through all three vertices. Thales' theorem implies that if the circumcenter is located on the side of the triangle, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. If the circumcenter is located inside the triangle, then the triangle is acute; if the circumcenter is located outside the triangle, then the triangle is obtuse....
