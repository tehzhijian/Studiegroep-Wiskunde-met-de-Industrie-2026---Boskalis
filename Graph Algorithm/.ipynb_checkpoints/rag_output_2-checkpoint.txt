=== CAUSAL RAG CHAIN RESULTS ===

QUERY 1: What happens when the circumcenter is on the side of the triangle?
FOUND 4 CAUSAL CHAINS:
  [PATH]: the circumcenter is located on the side of the triangle -> the triangle is acute
  [PATH]: the circumcenter is located on the side of the triangle -> the triangle is obtuse
  [PATH]: the circumcenter is located on the side of the triangle -> the angle opposite that side is a right angle
  [PATH]: and only if three pairs of corresponding sides of two triangles are all in the same proportion -> the triangles are similar
------------------------------------------------------------
QUERY 2: What influences the velocity of a Brownian particle?
FOUND 3 CAUSAL CHAINS:
  [PATH]: the enormous number of bombardments a Brownian particle will undergo -> roughly of the order of 1014 collisions per second
  [PATH]: roughly of the order of 1014 collisions per second -> velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10
  [PATH]: the enormous number of bombardments a Brownian particle will undergo -> roughly of the order of 1014 collisions per second -> velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10
------------------------------------------------------------
QUERY 3: Tell me about surface tension and minimal surfaces.
FOUND 2 CAUSAL CHAINS:
  [PATH]: The balance between the forces of inertia and surface tension -> the opening velocity
  [PATH]: Surface tension indeed -> surface minimization and
